# Object Localization with Python

This repository demonstrates a pipeline for localizing objects in images using Python libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, and Albumentations. The notebook (`Object_Localization.ipynb`) covers data loading and preprocessing, data augmentation, building and training a model for bounding box regression, and visualizing the results.

## Overview
Object localization involves identifying objects within an image and placing bounding boxes around them. In this project:
- **Data** is loaded, resized, and normalized for consistency.
- **Augmentations** are performed using Albumentations.
- **CNN** is used to predict bounding boxes.
- **Evaluation** includes accuracy metrics and bounding-box visualizations.

## Data Loading & Preprocessing
1. Reads image data from a dataset or directory structure.
2. Resizes images to a fixed size and normalizes pixel values.
3. Organizes data into train and validation splits.

## Data Augmentation
- Utilizes Albumentations for transformations (e.g. horizontal/vertical flips).
- Increases diversity of the dataset to reduce overfitting.

## Model Architecture
- Implements a convolutional neural network.
- Output layer predicts bounding-box coordinates.

## Training & Evaluation
- Uses mean squared error for bounding-box prediction.

## Results & Visualization
- Presents bounding boxes overlaid on validation images.
- Highlights predicted regions vs ground truth regions for comparison.
- Calculates intersection over union.
